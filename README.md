# Getting started

* Install ReyozaSdk Nuget package: https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReyozaSdk
* Register on the [Reyoza website](https://www.Reyoza.ru/) to get your username and password, or use `Credentials.TestCredentials`
* Create `ReyozaClient` using your credentials and connect to either endpoint:
  * `ReyozaClient.SandboxApiUrl` — for testing
  * `ReyozaClient.ProductionApiUrl` — for production code
* Set `ReyozaClient.Tracer` callback to your favorite logger's `WriteLine` method:
  * Tracer = Console.WriteLine — to trace all API calls to the system console
  * Tracer = TestContext.Progress.WriteLine — to trace your unit tests to Visual Studio Output window 
* Invoke `ReyozaClient` methods to calculate delivery tariffs, place orders, etc.
* Consult the original API documentation for the available methods:
  * [Russian documentation](https://api.Reyoza.ru/docs/)

## Sample code


```c#
var client = new ReyozaClient();

// trace all API calls to the console
client.Tracer = Console.WriteLine;

var stores = client.GetStores();
```


# SDK versioning

The project uses [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning) tool to manage versions.  
Each library build can be traced back to the original git commit.

## Preparing and publishing a new release

1. Make sure that `nbgv` dotnet CLI tool is installed and is up to date
2. Run `nbgv prepare-release` to create a stable branch for the upcoming release, i.e. release/v1.0
3. Switch to the release branch: `git checkout release/v1.0`
4. Execute unit tests, update the README, etc. Commit and push your changes.
5. Run `dotnet pack -c Release` and check that it builds Nuget packages with the right version number.
6. Run `nbgv tag release/v1.0` to tag the last commit on the release branch with your current version number, i.e. v1.0.7.
7. Push tags as suggested by nbgv tool: `git push origin v1.0.7`
8. Go to github project page and create a release out of the last tag v1.0.7.
9. Verify that github workflow for publishing the nuget package has completed.
